These are syntax highlighting files for the VIM editor. Included are:

* llvm.vim

  Syntax highlighting mode for LLVM assembly files. To use, COPY `llvm.vim' to
  ~/.vim/syntax and add this code to your ~/.vimrc :

  augroup filetype
    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.ll     set filetype=llvm
    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.llx    set filetype=llvm
  augroup END

* tablegen.vim

  Syntax highlighting mode for TableGen description files. To use, COPY
  `tablegen.vim' to ~/.vim/syntax and add this code to your ~/.vimrc :

  augroup filetype
    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.td     set filetype=tablegen
  augroup END


IMPORTANT: Making symlinks from ~/.vim/syntax/... to the syntax files in your
LLVM source tree does not work, you DO need to copy the files directly.

However, if you do not already have a ~/.vim/syntax/ directory, simply
symlinking it to llvm/utils/vim will do the trick nicely, and you can stay
up-to-date with CVS.

Note: If you notice missing or incorrect syntax highlighting, please contact
<llvmbugs [at] cs.uiuc.edu>; if you wish to provide a patch to improve the
functionality, it will be most appreciated. Thank you.

If you find yourself working with LLVM Makefiles often, but you don't get syntax
highlighting (because the files have names such as Makefile.rules or
TEST.nightly.Makefile), add the following to your ~/.vimrc:

  " LLVM Makefile highlighting mode
  augroup filetype
    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *Makefile*     set filetype=make
  augroup END
